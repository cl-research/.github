# CL Research Space 

HelloðŸ‘‹ This is a continual learning algorithm research space. Mainly, I'm doing class-incremental learning research here and I'm also using this to archive related researches.

## Libraries

- [FACIL: Framework for Analysis of Class-Incremental Learning](https://github.com/mmasana/FACIL)
- [PyCIL: A Python Toolbox for Class-Incremental Learning](https://github.com/G-U-N/PyCIL)
- [A continual learning survey: Defying forgetting in classification tasks](https://github.com/Mattdl/CLsurvey)
- [Mammoth - An Extendible (General) Continual Learning Framework for Pytorch](https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth)
- [Avalanche: an End-to-End Library for Continual Learning](https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche)
